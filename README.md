# Code Challenges Repository 

Welcome to the **JavaScript Code Challenges Repository**! This repository contains solutions to three interactive coding challenges aimed at improving JavaScript skills while solving practical problems.

## Challenges Overview 

1. **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator **  
2. **Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator **  
3. **Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator ðŸ“±**  

Each challenge is implemented using **Node.js** and the **readline module** for user interaction in a terminal environment.

## Challenge 1: Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator 

### **Description**
This program calculates the ingredients required to prepare a specified number of **cups of Kenyan chai** based on a standard recipe.

### **Standard Recipe (Per Cup)**
- **Water:** 200 ml  
- **Milk:** 50 ml  
- **Tea Leaves:** 1 tablespoon  
- **Sugar:** 2 teaspoons  

### **How It Works**
1. Prompts the user to enter the number of cups of chai they want to prepare.
2. Validates the input.
3. Calculates the required amount for each ingredient.
4. Displays the results in a **formatted output**.

### **How to Run**
```sh
cd ChaiCalculator
node chai.js


### *Challenge 2: Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator**
Description
This program estimates the fare for a boda boda ride based on a distance-based pricing system.
Fare Calculation Rules
- Base Fare: KES 50
- Per Kilometer Charge: KES 15
How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter the distance in kilometers for their trip.
- Validates the input.
- Calculates the total estimated fare using the formula:
**totalFare = baseFare + (distanceInKm * chargePerKm);**

Challenge 2: Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator ðŸ›µ
Description
This program estimates the fare for a boda boda ride based on a distance-based pricing system.
Fare Calculation Rules
- Base Fare: KES 50
- Per Kilometer Charge: KES 15
How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter the distance in kilometers for their trip.
- Validates the input.
- Calculates the total estimated fare using the formula:
**transactionFee = Math.max(minFee, Math.min(amountToSend * feePercentage, maxFee));**

Conclusion ðŸŽ¯
This repository provides practical JavaScript solutions to everyday problems, from estimating transaction fees to calculating boda boda fares and chai ingredients. Through these challenges, we have applied basic arithmetic operations, conditional logic, and user interaction handling using Node.js.
By working on these coding exercises, developers can strengthen their JavaScript skills, learn to process user input dynamically, and implement real-world problem-solving techniques. Whether you're a beginner exploring JavaScript or an experienced developer refining your skills, these challenges offer a fun and engaging way to enhance your coding journey! ðŸš€
